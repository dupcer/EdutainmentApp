# EDUTAINMENT APP

## Description
### What the App does.
It's an educational game that makes gaining arithmetic skills to be fun and joyful. It allows user to choose what type of arithmetics to do (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or any of it). To set the range of numbers to play with. And to set how many tasks the user wants to have. Once user starts solving tasks he would see the progress bar. When all tasks are done -- the user sees a table of all tasks he had, marked red or green, depending on -- was the given answer correct or not, and the overall stats of his performance. 

### What technologies I used
Swift, UIKit, Storyboard, MVC model. 

I've worked with: UITableVC, UIButton, UILabel, UIStepper, UISlider, UISegmentedControl, UIStackView, UIProgressView.

### Tests and TDD
I used TDD approach, for Model, writing unit tests before actual implementation. It did help me a lot later, as I was making any changes to my Model it was quick and easy to detect any problems that my Controller would have otherwise.
